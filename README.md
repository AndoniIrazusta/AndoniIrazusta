ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andoni Irazusta Garmendia

PhD student at the University of the Basque Country (UPV / EHU). My research is mainly focused on the use of learning algorithms in combinatorial optimization. I intend to improve the metaheuristic algorithms in aspects such as the convergence of the problem, the scalability to larger instances and the transferability to different executions, instances and problems.
